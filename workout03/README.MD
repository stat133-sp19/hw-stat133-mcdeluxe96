### Binomial Distribution
The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete
random variables. This is the theoretical probability model that we use when calculating
probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed
under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).
