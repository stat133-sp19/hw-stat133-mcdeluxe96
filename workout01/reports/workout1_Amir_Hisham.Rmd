# Trials and Errors: Same Goes with the Warriors
> He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life - Muhammad Ali

All great sportsmen have one thing in common. They have all failed at some point in their lives. The same thing can be said about the Warriors players for the 2016 season. We will look at five key players and analyze their shooting styles, and pointers to see how well they did in the 2016 season.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/gsw-shot-charts.png')
```

The figures above lay out every shot made by the five key players. As we see, Klay Thompson and Steph Curry made the most shots, with Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala came out third, forth and fifth players respectively in the number of shots. Knowing this, basketball players have to try harder to make more shots because all great players have that same characteristic. Note that this is for the 2016 season alone. If all the years are combined and analyzed, we would see the entire figures above fully colored with either green or red!

The figure below shows what happens if we dissect further and only look at Steph Curry figure alone.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('../images/steph-curry-shot-chart.png')
```
Based on this figure, we can see clearly where the shots were made, and whether or not he actually made the shot. As you can see, there is no definite x and y coordinates on the diagram where the shots made are completely green or red. We can see however that as he gets closer to the ring, the amount of green dots seem to be higher. However, by looking at the general overview of the diagram, no matter where the shot was made, there is no definite answer as to whether the shot actually passed or not. This reinforces the idea of the law of averages whereby if the player keeps on trying, they are bound to make the shot. Hence, other players should not hesitate to try and see if they could make the shots, even though they know that they might miss it. It's the effort that counts.

However, we should take into account their experience too when coming up with the conclusion that other basketball players should try more because the difference between Steph Curry and Klay Thomson with other basketball players is that they can actually score more points than others because of their talent. While we cannot hypothesise this by just looking at the diagram, let's make a hypothesis that they were only able to make more shots because of their talents for now even though we may not sure if the hypothesis is true. We will come back to this question later on.

We should also take into account the players ranks in the team. For example, Steph Curry and Klay Thomson are two basketball players that everyone respects. Other teammates might incline to pass the balls to them more than anybody else in the team. Although it is hard to hypothesise this because there are no appropriate tools to measure respects from other teammates, we should take into account that perhaps it wasn't that other basketball players did not try that hard, it is just that they have earned respect, and from that respect they were able to get more shots. 

Let's analyze these figures below showing the the percentages of shots made out of the overall shots. As we can see, Steph Curry does not have the highest percentage made, and Kevin Durant has the highest percentage which was 60%. The second highest only goes to Steph Curry. This shows that even though Kevin Durant didn't make as much shots as Steph Curry, his actually made his shots more than Steph Curry.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
shooting_two <-
  summarise(
    group_by(binded_data, name),
    total = sum(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
    made = sum(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
    perc_made = made/total)
shooting_two
```
Let's look at 3 pointer field goal. Given how hard it is to make a 3 pointer shot, the percentages of shots actually made are very low. In this case, Klay Thomson has the highest percentage made which was 42% while the percentage for Steph Curry was 40%. It should be noted that even the highest percentage made for 3 pointer is overwhelmingly less than the 2 pointer percentages. 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
shooting_three <-
  summarise(
    group_by(binded_data, name),
    total = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
    made = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal" & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
    perc_made = made/total)
shooting_three
```
Lastly, let's look at the overall percentage which was to combine both 2 pointer and 3 pointer and calculate the percentages. Here we see that Kevin Durant made the highest total percentage made. The second and third on the list are Klay Thomson and Steph Curry.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
shooting_overall <-
  summarise(
    group_by(binded_data, name),
    total = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal" | shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
    made = sum((shot_type == "3PT Field Goal" | shot_type == "2PT Field Goal") & shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
    perc_made = made/total)
shooting_overall
```

The overall conclusion of this report is to show that the more shots you made does not entirely make you better. However, even if you're unprofessional, it doesn't mean that you won't score any point. Here we see that Steph Curry and Klay Thomson does not necessarily make their shots, in fact, their percentages are close to the mean. However, if you try it well, you might make the shot.
